| File Name                         | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| `coin_toss_events.py`            | Simulates tossing multiple coins and filters outcomes (e.g., exactly 2 heads). |
| `dice_roll_probability.py`       | Simulates rolling dice and calculates probability of a specific outcome like rolling a 6. |
| `law_of_large_numbers.py`        | Demonstrates how probability of heads converges to 0.5 using graphs. |
| `sample_space.py`                | Generates sample spaces for 2-coin tosses, 2-dice rolls, and combined events. |
| `head_probability_estimation.py` | Runs large-scale simulation (e.g., 1 million tosses) to estimate P(Head). |
| `predict_rain_probability.ipynb` | Uses past 100 years' weather data to predict rain on a specific date using probability. |
